# Vulnerable-Machine
A simple vulnerable machine created as a project for Ethical Hacking course

We tried to create a PS-1 themed vulnerable machine, but failed.. Anyway this machine would be good for beginners to understand and perform some techniques like traffic analysis, portforwarding, portknocking etc...
